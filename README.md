# Bamazon
Bamazon is a store-front application where users can purchase items in stocl.

# Motivation
I created this game as a part of the curriculum of the Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp at UConn, offered by Trilogy. 

# Tech Used
This app was built with javascript, mySQL workbench, and npm libraries. 

# How It Works
Using the terminal, users can select to see the items in the Bamazon store and their quantity. The inquirer prompt is run twice, asking the user to make a purchase. The user must select the product by ID number and confirm the quantity they wish to buy. A function is run confirming the purchase and another is run to update the database's quantity of that item. Users can continue to make purchases until the items they wish to buy are out of stock.
